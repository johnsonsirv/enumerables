# Ruby Enumerable Methods
The Enumerable module that gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) provides you with lots of handy iterator methods.
In this project I re-built some of those methods to demonstrate their internal workings. The implementation covers basic operations
of these iterators, and does not take into account certain complexities. TDD approach was adopted. and tests where written using Rspec framework.

See [Documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Enumerable.html) for complete details on Ruby Enumerables.

This project was completed in line with standards provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

## Technologies
- Ruby
- Rspec
- TDD

## Methods (iterators)
The custom methods covered in this project include:
- #my_each
- #my_each_with_index
- #my_select
- #my_all?
- #my_any?
- #my_none?
- #my_count
- #my_map
- #my_inject
>  Note: #my_inject is a partial implementation as it does not take into account certain complexities.

## Getting Started
> Clone the repository to your local machine
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/johnsonsirv/enumerables.git
```
> navigate ```cd ``` into the cloned directory

```sh
$ cd enumerable
```
> load the module ```enumerable ``` 

```sh
 require "[RELATIVE_PATH]/enumerable"
```
> See some examples on how to use the methods
```sh
arr = [2,3,4,5].my_each {|val| puts "#{val} apples!"}

# => 2 apples!
# => 3 apples!
# => 4 apples!
# => 5 apples!

puts (1..10).my_count {|num| num % 2 == 0}

# => 5
```
